# ComputingContests
By Haydn Keung
All solutions are written in Java.
My Solutions to Canadian Computing Contest and DMOJ contests in Java
Free free to take a look at my solutions to past CCC and DMOJ contests as a reference to provide hints/tips. Most solutions are correct
although some solutions may be too slow/fail edge cases. These are not official solutions and CCC/DMOJ does not endorse these solutions
in any way. Have fun & good luck!!!
